**xAI Workspace** gives you a dedicated AI agent accessible right inside Telegram — no apps to install, no accounts to create.

## How it works

1. **Start the bot** — Send \`/start\` to begin. You'll get a free trial instantly.
2. **Just chat** — Send any message and your AI agent will respond. It understands context, can help with research, writing, coding, and more.
3. **Your own instance** — Unlike shared AI chatbots, you get a dedicated agent that runs on its own server with persistent memory.

## What makes xAI Workspace different

- **Private** — Your conversations stay on your dedicated instance
- **Persistent** — Your agent remembers context across sessions
- **Powerful** — Powered by Claude, one of the most capable AI models
- **Simple** — It's just Telegram. No new apps, no learning curve

## 1. Start the bot

Open Telegram and send \`/start\` to **@xAIWorkspaceBot**. Your free trial begins immediately — no credit card needed.

## 2. Wait for provisioning

Your dedicated AI instance takes about 2 minutes to set up. You'll receive a notification when it's ready.

## 3. Send your first message

Just type anything! Try:
- "What can you help me with?"
- "Summarise the latest news about AI"
- "Write a Python script that sorts a list"

## 4. Explore commands

- \`/usage\` — Check your token balance
- \`/models\` — Switch between AI models
- \`/billing\` — Manage your subscription
- \`/language\` — Change your preferred language
- \`/ssh\` — Get SSH access to your instance
- \`/stop\` — Hibernate your instance when not in use
- \`/help\` — See all available commands

xAI Workspace supports multiple AI models from several providers. Switch between them with \`/models\`.

## Available Models

| Model | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet** | Everyday tasks — fast, capable, balanced |
| **Claude Opus** | Complex reasoning, research, long documents |
| **Claude Haiku** | Quick answers, simple tasks, lowest cost |
| **GPT-4o** | General-purpose, good at structured output |
| **DeepSeek** | Cost-effective reasoning and coding |
| **Gemini** | Multimodal tasks, large context windows |

## Switching models

1. Send \`/models\` in the chat
2. Tap the model you want to use
3. A ✓ appears next to your active model

Your selection persists across sessions. You can switch anytime.

## Token usage

Different models consume tokens at different rates. Opus uses more tokens per response than Haiku. Check your balance with \`/usage\`.

Every xAI Workspace instance comes with full SSH access — you own the machine.

## Getting your credentials

1. Send \`/ssh\` in the Telegram chat
2. The bot sends you a \`.pem\` private key file along with connection details:
   - **Host** — your instance's public IP
   - **Port** — 22
   - **User** — ubuntu

## Connecting

\`\`\`bash
# Save the key file, then set permissions (required)
chmod 600 openclaw.pem

# Connect
ssh -i openclaw.pem ubuntu@<your-host-ip>
\`\`\`

> If you get a "permission denied" error, double-check that you ran \`chmod 600\` on the key file.

## What you can do

Once connected you land in \`/home/ubuntu\` on your dedicated instance:

- Browse and edit your persisted files
- Tail agent logs in real time
- Install additional tools and runtimes
- Run scripts, cron jobs, or services alongside your AI agent
- Transfer files with \`scp\` or \`rsync\`

## When the key isn't ready

If your instance is still being provisioned, the bot will reply:

> *"Failed to retrieve SSH key. Your instance may still be provisioning."*

Wait a couple of minutes for setup to complete and try \`/ssh\` again.

## Security

- **Ed25519 keypair** — generated uniquely for each client during provisioning
- **Key-only auth** — password authentication is disabled
- **No root login** — \`PermitRootLogin\` is set to \`no\`
- Your private key is stored encrypted in a private S3 bucket and only delivered to your Telegram chat

## Plans

| Plan | Price | Tokens |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Trial** | Free | 50K |
| **Essential** | $100/mo | 750K |
| **Professional** | $300/mo | 3M |
| **Enterprise** | $600/mo | 8M |

## Managing your subscription

Send \`/billing\` to open the billing dashboard where you can:
- View your current plan and renewal date
- Upgrade or downgrade
- Enable auto top-up for extra token packs
- Update your payment method

## Token packs

Running low? Enable **auto top-up** in \`/billing\` to automatically purchase extra tokens when you hit your limit.

## Payment history

Send \`/invoices\` to view all past payments and receipts.

## Be specific

Instead of "help me write an email", try:
> "Write a professional email to my client John declining the Friday meeting. Suggest Tuesday or Wednesday instead. Keep it brief and friendly."

## Use context

Your agent remembers the conversation. Build on previous messages:
1. "Analyse this CSV data: ..."
2. "Now create a chart showing the monthly trend"
3. "Add a summary paragraph for the executive team"

## Choose the right model

- **Quick question?** → Haiku (fastest, cheapest)
- **Everyday work?** → Sonnet (default, balanced)
- **Complex analysis?** → Opus (most capable)

Switch with \`/models\`.

## Monitor usage

Check \`/usage\` regularly to track your token consumption. The progress bar shows your monthly allocation.

## Hibernation

Your instance hibernates automatically when idle to save resources. Just send any message to wake it up — it takes about 30 seconds. You can also manually hibernate with \`/stop\`.

Your language preference is auto-detected from your Telegram settings on first use, but you can change it anytime. All bot messages will appear in your selected language.

## Change region

Send \`/region\` to move your AI instance to a different server region. This can reduce latency if you're closer to another data centre.

Available regions are shown with your current selection highlighted.
