**xAI Workspace** gives you a dedicated AI agent accessible right inside xAI Workspace — no apps to install, no accounts to create.

## How it works

1. **Start the bot** — Send \`/start\` to begin. You'll get a free trial instantly.
2. **Just chat** — Send any message and your AI agent will respond. It understands context, can help with research, writing, coding, and more.
3. **Your own instance** — Unlike shared AI chatbots, you get a dedicated agent that runs on its own server with persistent memory.

## What makes xAI Workspace different

- **Private** — Your conversations stay on your dedicated instance
- **Persistent** — Your agent remembers context across sessions
- **Powerful** — Powered by Claude, one of the most capable AI models
- **Simple** — It's just xAI Workspace. No new apps, no learning curve

## 1. Start the bot

Open xAI Workspace and send \`/start\` to **@xAIWorkspaceBot**. Your free trial begins immediately — no credit card needed.

## 2. Wait for provisioning

Your dedicated AI instance takes about 2 minutes to set up. You'll receive a notification when it's ready.

## 3. Send your first message

Just type anything! Try:
- "What can you help me with?"
- "Summarise the latest news about AI"
- "Write a Python script that sorts a list"

## 4. Explore commands

- \`/authorize\` — Connect Google, Microsoft, GitHub and more
- \`/usage\` — Check your token balance
- \`/billing\` — Manage your subscription
- \`/language\` — Change your preferred language
- \`/ssh\` — Connect to your workspace for file access
- \`/help\` — See all available commands
- \`/models\` — Switch between AI models

  models: {
    title: 'AI Models',
    subtitle: 'Choose the right model for your task',
    content: `
xAI Workspace supports multiple AI models from several providers. Switch between them with \`/models\`.

## Available Models

| Model | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet** | Everyday tasks — fast, capable, balanced |
| **Claude Opus** | Complex reasoning, research, long documents |
| **Claude Haiku** | Quick answers, simple tasks, lowest cost |
| **GPT-4o** | General-purpose, good at structured output |
| **DeepSeek** | Cost-effective reasoning and coding |
| **Gemini** | Multimodal tasks, large context windows |

## Switching models

1. Send \`/models\` in the chat
2. Tap the model you want to use
3. A ✓ appears next to your active model

Your selection persists across sessions. You can switch anytime.

## Token usage

Different models consume tokens at different rates. Opus uses more tokens per response than Haiku. Check your balance with \`/usage\`.

  'remote-access': {
    title: 'Remote Access',
    subtitle: 'SSH and SFTP access to your workspace',
    content: `
Every xAI Workspace instance is your own dedicated machine. You can connect via SSH or SFTP to manage files, run tools, and customise your environment.

## Getting your key

1. Send \`/ssh\` in the xAI Workspace chat
2. The bot sends you a \`.pem\` key file with connection details
3. Save the file and set permissions before connecting

## SSH — Terminal access

\`\`\`bash
# Set permissions on the key file (required, one-time)
chmod 600 <chatId>-xaiworkspace.pem

# Connect via the bastion host
ssh -i <chatId>-xaiworkspace.pem xai<chatId>@ssh.xaiworkspace.com
\`\`\`

Replace \`<chatId>\` with your xAI Workspace chat ID (shown in the key filename).

> If you get a "permission denied" error, double-check that you ran \`chmod 600\` on the key file.

## SFTP — File transfer

You can use any SFTP client to upload and download files:

\`\`\`bash
# Command-line SFTP
sftp -i <chatId>-xaiworkspace.pem xai<chatId>@ssh.xaiworkspace.com
\`\`\`

### FileZilla — Step-by-step setup

FileZilla is a free, cross-platform SFTP client. Follow these steps to connect to your workspace:

#### 1. Download and install FileZilla

Download FileZilla Client (not Server) from [filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org). Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### 2. Open the Site Manager

Launch FileZilla and go to **File → Site Manager** (or press **Ctrl+S** on Windows/Linux, **Cmd+S** on macOS).

#### 3. Create a new site

1. Click **New Site**
2. Name it **xAI Workspace**

#### 4. Enter connection settings

Fill in the right-hand panel:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Protocol** | SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol |
| **Host** | ssh.xaiworkspace.com |
| **Port** | 22 |
| **Logon Type** | Key file |
| **User** | xai\`<chatId>\` |

#### 5. Add your key file

1. In the **Key file** field, click **Browse...**
2. Select the \`.pem\` file you downloaded from \`/ssh\`
3. If FileZilla asks to convert the key to PPK format, click **Yes** — it will save a converted copy automatically

> On macOS or Linux, make sure you ran \`chmod 600\` on the .pem file first.

#### 6. Connect

1. Click **Connect**
2. On the first connection, FileZilla shows an "Unknown host key" dialog — check the details and click **OK** to trust the server

#### 7. Transfer files

- The **left panel** shows your local files
- The **right panel** shows your workspace files
- **Drag and drop** files between panels to upload or download
- **Right-click** for rename, delete, and permission options

> **Tip:** Your site is saved in Site Manager. Next time, open Site Manager and double-click **xAI Workspace** to reconnect instantly.

Other graphical SFTP clients like **Cyberduck** and **WinSCP** work too — use the same host, port, username, and key file settings above.

## What you can do

Once connected, your workspace is fully yours:

- **Manage files** — browse, edit, upload, and download documents
- **Monitor activity** — view your agent's logs in real time
- **Install tools** — add any software or runtimes you need
- **Run automations** — set up scheduled tasks or background services
- **Transfer files** — use \`scp\`, \`rsync\`, or SFTP to move files

## If your workspace is still setting up

If your workspace is still being provisioned, the bot will let you know. Wait a couple of minutes and try \`/ssh\` again.

## Security

- All connections go through a **bastion host** — your instance is never directly exposed to the internet
- A unique ed25519 encryption key is generated for each workspace during setup
- Password login is disabled — only your personal key file works
- Root access is restricted for safety
- Your key is stored encrypted in S3 and only delivered to your xAI Workspace chat

## Be specific

Instead of "help me write an email", try:
> "Write a professional email to my client John declining the Friday meeting. Suggest Tuesday or Wednesday instead. Keep it brief and friendly."

## Use context

Your agent remembers the conversation. Build on previous messages:
1. "Analyse this CSV data: ..."
2. "Now create a chart showing the monthly trend"
3. "Add a summary paragraph for the executive team"

## Choose the right model

- **Quick question?** → Haiku (fastest, cheapest)
- **Everyday work?** → Sonnet (default, balanced)
- **Complex analysis?** → Opus (most capable)

Switch with \`/models\`.

## Monitor usage

Check \`/usage\` regularly to track your token consumption. The progress bar shows your monthly allocation.

Your language preference is auto-detected from your xAI Workspace settings on first use, but you can change it anytime. All bot messages will appear in your selected language.

## Change region

Send \`/region\` to move your AI instance to a different server region. This can reduce latency if you're closer to another data centre.

Available regions are shown with your current selection highlighted.
